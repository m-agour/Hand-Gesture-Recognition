Hand Gesture Recognition
This project uses the MediaPipe hands library to recognize hand gestures in real time. The project can be used to recognize a variety of gestures, including:

Like
Hi
Stop
To use the project, first install the MediaPipe hands library and the TensorFlow deep learning library. Then, clone the repository and run the main.py script. The script will open a window that displays a live video feed. When you make a gesture, the script will recognize the gesture and display the corresponding label in the window.

Example
In the following example, the user is making a "like" gesture. The script recognizes the gesture and displays the label "like" in the window.
