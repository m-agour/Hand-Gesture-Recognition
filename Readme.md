# Hand Gesture Recognition

**Imagine a world where you can control your devices with your hands.** You can use hand gestures to turn on your TV, change the channel, or even play a game. This is the future of human-computer interaction, and it's possible with hand gesture recognition.

This project uses the [MediaPipe hands library](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands) to recognize hand gestures in real time. The project can be used to recognize a variety of gestures, including:

* Like
* Hi
* Stop

## How to use

To use the project, first install the [MediaPipe hands library](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands) and the [TensorFlow deep learning library](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Then, clone the repository and run the `main.py` script. The script will open a window that displays a live video feed. When you make a gesture, the script will recognize the gesture and display the corresponding label in the window.

## Ideas for use

Here are some ideas for how you can use this project:

* **Control your devices with your hands.** You can use hand gestures to turn on your TV, change the channel, or even play a game.
* **Create new ways for people with disabilities to interact with computers.** Hand gesture recognition can be used to create new ways for people with disabilities to interact with computers. For example, people with limited mobility can use hand gestures to control their computers.
* **Create new forms of art and entertainment.** Hand gesture recognition can be used to create new forms of art and entertainment. For example, you could use hand gestures to create music or to control a virtual puppet.

## This is just a starting point.

With your creativity, the possibilities are endless.
